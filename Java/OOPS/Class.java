/*
    ðŸ”¹ Definition of Class:
    A class in Java is a blueprint or template for creating objects. 
    It defines variables (fields) and methods (functions) that represent 
    the properties and behaviors of objects.

    ðŸ”¹ Definition of Object:
    An object is an instance of a class. 
    It represents a real-world entity and has its own state (data) 
    and behavior (methods).

/*
    ðŸ”¹ Key Points:
    1. Class = Blueprint/template.
    2. Object = Instance of a class.
    3. Objects are created using 'new' keyword.
    4. Each object has its own data but shares methods of the class.
