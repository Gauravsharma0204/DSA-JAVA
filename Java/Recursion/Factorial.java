    Important Notes
    ‚úÖ Recursion is simpler & cleaner for problems like factorial, Fibonacci, tree/graph traversal.
    ‚ö†Ô∏è But recursion can cause stack overflow if base condition is missing.
    üöÄ Iterative methods (loops) are sometimes faster than recursion because recursion has overhead of function calls.
